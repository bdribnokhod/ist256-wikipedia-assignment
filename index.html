        <p style="font-style:italic">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more people named Bogdan Dribnokhod, don't even look.</p>
    <p><b>Bogdan Dribnokhod</b> (born November 17, 2004) is a total bum and a complete failure. He is well known for wasting time,
    not doing what he is supposed to, as well as spending most of his time sitting at the
        <a href="https://mfau.net/" target="_blank">Myerstown First Aid Unit</a> station, thinking that he is actually doing something useful for the community, when in reality,
        he is just wasting his life away.</p>
    <p>Bogdan is currently studying IST-Cybersecurity at the <a href="https://www.psu.edu/" target="_blank">Pennsylvania State University</a>
    , and so far it is a bit difficult to do so due to his inability to get his butt up and do his work. He is Advanced-EMT certified, which might sound cool,
        but actually is simply an attempt to look like he knows something about Emergency Medicine, which he actually does not.</p>




    <div class="Earlife">
        <h2 style="font-weight:lighter">Early Life</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Bogdan was born in the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine on November 17, 2004. He spent his early life doing who knows what, trying to make it in the pre-2014 conditions in Ukraine.
            In 2016, Bogdan and his family moved over to the United States and settled in the small town in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon_County,_Pennsylvania" target="_blank">Lebanon County, PA</a>.
        <p>Soon after settling, Bogdan started attending school at the Eastern Lebanon County School District, where he made a few good friends and later graduated from. While attending ELCO High School,
            Bogdan took a class to obtain his EMT-B Certification, which he shaped his post-school life.</p>
        <p>
            He also worked on learning how to play multiple musical instruments during his middle school/high school years like: guitar, flute, drums, and others. He is by no means any good, but he thinks he can play stuff.
        </p>

    <div class="Today">
        <h2 style="font-weight: lighter">Today</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Today, Bogdan attends the Pennsylvania State University, studying IST:Cybersecurity. He also obtained his Advanced EMT certification in 2024,
            and he works at multiple EMS companies across 3 different counties. Bogdan has recently been placed as the Chairman of the Electronic Operations Department at the Myerstown First Aid Unit.
            Bogdan does not know what he is doing, but he hopes to learn.</p>
        <p>Bogdan also spends a lot of time serving in his church playing guitar and handling the sound system. I am running out of words to say to be completely honest, so I am just going to stop now.</p>
